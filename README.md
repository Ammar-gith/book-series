Developed a comprehensive online Book Series Guide application using Laravel, tailored for students preparing for academic tests. The platform organizes content into multiple books such as Urdu, Pak Studies, and more. Each book is divided into units, with each unit further segmented into sections, and every section contains multiple practice questions. This structured approach enhances focused learning and effective exam preparation.
